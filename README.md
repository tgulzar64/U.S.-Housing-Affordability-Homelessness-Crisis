# U.S. Housing Affordability & Homelessness Crisis  
### A Multi-City, Data-Driven Analysis (Boston, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington D.C.)

This project investigates the **growing housing affordability crisis in the United States** and its implications for **housing insecurity and homelessness**. Using housing price indices, wage data, renter affordability metrics, and time-series forecasting models, the analysis evaluates whether current housing market trends are economically sustainable for middle- and lower-income households.

The study combines **economic analysis, forecasting, and policy-oriented insights** to assess how rising housing costs are structurally excluding large segments of the population from both homeownership and renting.

## 📌 Key Research Question

**Are U.S. cities on a trajectory toward widespread housing unaffordability and increased homelessness if current trends persist?**

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources

The analysis integrates multiple authoritative datasets:

- **Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)** – Home price trends
- **Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)** – Rental price trends
- **Zillow Observed Renter Demand Index (ZORDI)** – Rental demand
- **Mortgage Payment Trends** – Cost of homeownership
- **New Renter Income Needed** – Income thresholds for renting
- **National Average Wage Index (SSA)** – Wage growth benchmark
- **DataUSA** – Income distribution by city

## 🔄 Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Trend analysis of housing prices since the early 2000s
- Comparison of wage growth vs housing inflation
- City-level affordability breakdowns

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Housing prices vs renter income requirements
- Rent indices vs renter demand
- Identification of structural affordability gaps

### 3. Forecasting & Time-Series Models
- **ARIMA forecasting** for housing prices
- **Exponential Smoothing** for affordability ratios
- Projections through **2029–2030**

### 4. Multi-City Case Studies
- **Boston** – Bottom-tier housing pressure
- **New York City** – Long-term price acceleration
- **Chicago** – Income distribution vs homeownership access
- **Los Angeles** – Rental affordability collapse
- **Washington D.C.** – Forecasted affordability decline

## 📊 Key Findings

### 🔹 Housing Prices Are Outpacing Wages
- Boston housing prices have grown nearly **4× faster than wages** since 2013
- By 2029, renters in Boston may require **>$130,000 annually** to afford housing
- National wages are projected to grow only marginally by comparison

### 🔹 Renting Is No Longer a Safety Net
- Rental affordability has deteriorated sharply in major cities
- Rising rents are pushing households into:
  - Overcrowding
  - Eviction cycles
  - Geographic displacement

### 🔹 Structural Exclusion of the Middle Class
- Chicago income distributions remain stable while affordability worsens
- Homeownership is increasingly inaccessible even for middle-income earners
- Forecasts show a **sharp rise in unaffordable households (2023–2028)**

### 🔹 Increased Risk of Homelessness
- Los Angeles and Washington D.C. show strong signals of:
  - Declining affordability ratios
  - Rent increases outpacing income growth
- Negative correlation between rent increases and renter demand suggests market exclusion

## 🏙️ City-Level Highlights

### Boston
- Strong correlation (0.92) between housing prices and renter income requirements
- Bottom-tier housing shows severe affordability stress

### New York City
- Long-term upward price trend with post-2008 acceleration
- Predicted prices exceed **$700,000 by 2030**

### Chicago
- Income needed for homeownership rose sharply post-2021
- Forecasted growth in unaffordable households through 2028

### Los Angeles
- Rental affordability projected to worsen despite rising incomes
- Rent increases are pushing renters out of the market

### Washington D.C.
- ARIMA and exponential smoothing models predict:
  - Continued home price growth
  - Declining affordability ratios
  - Shift from ownership to renting or relocation

## 🧠 Policy Implications

Without intervention, the data suggests:
- Rising homelessness risk across major U.S. cities
- Economic displacement of middle-class workers
- Long-term urban inequality and labor mobility challenges
